Smoove - A feed reader that lets users share with their friends. Written in PHP/MYSQL

Smoove currently uses the Zend Framework for parsing feeds along with a few other things.

I'm going to be adding to this a piece at a time. Feel free to use any of the code,
but there's a pretty good chance it's not going to work without the rest of the codebase.
